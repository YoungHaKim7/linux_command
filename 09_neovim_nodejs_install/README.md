# (nodejs)What you need to do is to remove the previous node version to avoid conflict

- sudo apt remove nodejs

- then, you can run:

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Mind you,

    setup_18.x

can be anyone node version you want to install
