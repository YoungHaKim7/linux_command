https://blog.desdelinux.net/en/install-discord-linux/

- Install Discord on Debian / Ubuntu

  - The version 'Discord Canary'has been packaged for Debian-based distributions. Users of Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, or any of its derivatives, should have no problem downloading the .deb from the Discord page, which you can then install with your favorite package manager. You can also follow the following steps:

  ```bash
  $ wget https://discordapp.com/api/download/canary?platform=linux
  ```

  - Once you are done downloading, just install it with dpkg.

  ```bash
  $ sudo dpkg -i /path/to/discord-canary-0.0.11.deb
  ```

  - Once done, you could run the application, and it can also be easily updated.
